(NOTE: The whole Supra Mayro thing was originally started by "reallyhandsomepeople", and this game is just a fan-made thing)

Booser has kidnapped Princess Pesh once again! This time, he took her to space 'cause he thought nobody would be able to find him there. However, he didn't know that Mayro owns a fully working spaceship, which he can use anytime to travel to space. The player will help Mayro collect 'Muun Starz,' which he will need to travel to different planets, but it won't be easy. Mayro will have to solve different kinds of problems, or puzzles on various planets to get the 'Muun Starz,' and on top of that, different enemies will try to stop Mayro from achieving his goal!

The game takes place four years after the events of Supra Mayro 64 Fan Made, and it's pretty much a continuation of the game I guess.

The save file that gets created when you save the game is located in "C:\Users\"UrPcNameOrWhatever"\AppData\LocalLow\Gusvenga Games\Supra Mayro Spacee Adwentur". It gets updated everytime you save the game, so drag the file out of the folder if you want to keep a certain save for later.

This game was originally supposed to be a sandbox city simulator game where you could do anything you want, but that idea was scrapped as soon as the idea of adding the outerspace to the game was spawned. The development of this game started in late 2023 and was it was supposed to be finished earlier. But I'm not one of those developers who can create a game in like a week.

This game still has some features that are unfinished and may be very broken, the multiplayer mode is an example of that. So please report any bugs on my Discord server!

To play the multiplayer mode with someone who's not near you, you'll need to download Hamachi, or Radmin VPN. After you do it, make or join a network with your friend so your networks are connected. You're ready to make a server! Click the multiplayer option on the main menu to enter the mode, then click on Lan Host (or press "H") to make a server, then click "Add Player" to spawn. To have your friend join your server, they will need to copy your IP found on the network whatever it is program you're using, then paste it into the Lan Client field where it originally says "localhost". Now after they click the Lan Client button itself (and "Add Player" too probably). they should be able to join your server. Now, everyone will have to to press ESC, then right click "START" on the multiplayer menu to start the game!
